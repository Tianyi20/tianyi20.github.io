# Profili


I'm a Robotics master student from [Yale University](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/mechanical-engineering-and-materials-science), major in [mechanical engineering & material science](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/research-areas/robotics-mechatronics-and-human-machine-interface). I like **Applied Motion Planning**, **Perception**, and **Vision Language Model** with practical robots!


**The goal of my work** is to enable people to intuitively control or work alongside robot manipulation platforms to perform critical tasks deemed unsuitable, undesirable, understaffed, or unsafe for people, such as industrial robotics arm assembly, remote teleoperation programming, soft robotics, and even control with virtual reality. I use interdisciplinary techniques across **robotics and computer science**, including **motion planning**,  **machine learning**, **visual-perception**, **Vision-language model**,**virtual reality**, **communication system** to formulate and validate solutions within problems in diverse fields.

I always consider how to bring a true agent into household?! And I consider it as a dynamic system as follow.

![project_proposal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d75ae4d9-36e0-4c43-b28e-ddd71f274163)


To achieve this goal, I have divided it into **four key areas**, each benefiting from my past experiences:

* (A) **Perception** – Category level Object Pose & Geometry & Mesh Estimation, better with Large Vision Modal.

* (B) **Vision Language Modal** – perform as robot's [brain]. Feed all stream coming from perception, task planner, achieving replanning in loop.  

* (C) **Basic Dyanmics** - general sampling based motion planning, with kinodynamics, deterity manipulation in special case.

* (D) **Multimodel-Sensor Perception** - Visual sensor, along with tactile sensor such as TENG, Soft electronic, Visual tactile sensor.
