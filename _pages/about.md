# Profili


I'm a Robotics master student from [Yale University](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/mechanical-engineering-and-materials-science), major in [mechanical engineering & material science](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/research-areas/robotics-mechatronics-and-human-machine-interface). I like **Applied Motion Planning**, **Hybrid Skill Planning**, and **Imitation Learning** with practical robots!


**The goal of my work** is to enable people to intuitively control or work alongside robot manipulation platforms to perform critical tasks deemed unsuitable, undesirable, understaffed, or unsafe for people, such as industrial robotics arm assembly, remote teleoperation programming, soft robotics, and even control with virtual reality. I use interdisciplinary techniques across **robotics and computer science**, including **motion planning**,  **machine learning**, **visual-perception**, **virtual reality**, **communication system** to formulate and validate solutions within problems in diverse fields.

The Statement of Proposal of my research can be illustrated as the **holistic integrated task and motion planning**!

![My Statement of Proposal](images/project overview.jpg)


To achieve this goal, I have divided it into **three key areas**, each benefiting from my past experiences: 

* (A) **Hybrid Skill Planning** – Task and Motion planning (PDDL), Reinforcement Learning, Behaviour Cloning (should transfer to task skill)...; 

* (B) **Motion planning, Perception, Control & Optimisation** - Optimisation-based motion planning, Sampling-based optimisation, Visual-to-Geometry & physical estimation(ongoing), Soft Actuator applied motion planning ...; 

* (C) **Multimodel-Sensor Perception** - Sensor Design along with motion detection such as TENG, Soft electronic, Visual tactile sensor.
