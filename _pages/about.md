# Profili
I'm a Robotics master student from Yale University. I like Applied Planning, Learning, and Optimization with practical robots!

My research primarily involves formulating planning, learning, and optimization algorithms that allow robot manipulation platforms to effectively complete tasks.

The goal of my work is to enable people to intuitively control or work alongside robot manipulation platforms to perform critical tasks deemed unsuitable, undesirable, understaffed, or unsafe for people, such as industrial robotics arm assembly, remote teleoperation programming, soft robotics, and even control with virtual reality. I use interdisciplinary techniques across robotics and computer science, including motion planning, automation, machine learning, vision, virtual reality, communication system to formulate and validate solutions within problems in diverse fields.
